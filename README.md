# 🎮 Twist Tac Toe

A modern, chaotic twist on the classic Tic‑Tac‑Toe you already know — built for fun, speed, and *unpredictability*.

**Twist Tac Toe** takes the simple 3×3 grid and bends the rules with multiple game modes, each introducing a unique mechanic that forces players to rethink strategy beyond just making three in a row.
